## My Contribution

**Role**: Swin Transformer Module Developer (Shizhuang Liu)

### Specific Responsibilities:
- **Swin Transformer Architecture Implementation**: Designed and implemented the Swin Transformer component for global feature extraction, generating 1024-dimensional feature representations
- **Hierarchical Attention Mechanism**: Developed the hierarchical attention layers to capture global contextual dependencies crucial for distinguishing visually similar pest species
- **Feature Integration Design**: Contributed to the feature fusion strategy that combines Swin Transformer outputs with ResNet-50 features
- **Global Context Modeling**: Focused on enabling the model to understand spatial relationships and global patterns in pest images across different scales

### Technical Implementation:
- Implemented Swin Transformer backbone for extracting global contextual features
- Optimized the transformer architecture for fine-grained pest classification tasks
- Contributed to the parallel feature extraction pipeline that processes input images through both Swin Transformer and ResNet-50 paths
- Participated in the model training strategy and hyperparameter optimization

**Note**: This project was completed as part of a collaborative team effort with 4 other members, each contributing to different components of the hybrid Swin-ResNet Combined Model.
